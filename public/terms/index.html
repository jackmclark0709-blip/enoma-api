    By accessing or using Enoma, you agree to these Terms of Service.
    If you do not agree, please do not use the service.
  </p>

  <h2>Description of service</h2>
  <p>
    Enoma provides hosted, SEO-optimized business profile pages that present
    information supplied by customers. Pages are published and maintained
    as part of an active subscription.
  </p>

  <h2>Customer responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring that all information you provide is
    accurate, lawful, and does not infringe on the rights of others.
  </p>

  <h2>Content ownership</h2>
  <p>
    You retain ownership of your business name and information.
    Enoma retains ownership of the platform, page structure, templates,
    and underlying technology.
  </p>

  <h2>No guarantees</h2>
  <p>
    Enoma does not guarantee search engine rankings, website traffic,
    lead volume, or business results. Outcomes depend on many factors
    beyond our control.
  </p>

  <h2>Payments & subscriptions</h2>
  <p>
    Subscription fees cover page creation, hosting, and maintenance.
    Fees are billed in advance and are non-refundable except where
    required by law. You may cancel your subscription at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>Cancellation & termination</h2>
  <p>
    Upon cancellation or non-payment, your page may be unpublished
    or disabled. Enoma reserves the right to suspend or terminate
    accounts that violate these terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, Enoma is not liable for
    indirect, incidental, consequential, or lost-profit damages
    arising from use of the service.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued
    use of the service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance
    of the updated terms.
